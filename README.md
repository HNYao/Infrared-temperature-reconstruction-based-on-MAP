# Infrared-temperature-reconstruction-based-on-JMAP

# Notes:
Attenuation during infrared propagation causes the measured temperature always to be less than the actual value.  A novel method of temperature reconstruction based on Bayesian inference is proposed. The improved infrared radiation model and JMAP method (IIRM-JMAP) can improve the accuracy of temperature measurement with no need to improve the hardware performance of the
measuring device. The improved infrared thermal radiation model is suitable for measuring scenarios
with different measuring distances, different humidity, and different emissivity. The proposed method
has been validated to have small errors (≤ 0.1℃) through various experiments on a black body, human
face, and high-speed direct-drive blower.
